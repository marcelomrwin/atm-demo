# ATM Demo

## Project Description

This project represents the work developed to fulfill a proof of concept with the following definition:

An institution called ATM that has information generically referred to as ATMTopics. These ATMTopics are generated by an internal solution called ATMLegacy with confidential data. ATM must offer this internally generated data to external collaborators known as ATMPartners. It is ATM's responsibility to distribute this data securely and ensure that only properly registered and validated ATMPartners have access to this information. There are some legal requirements that ATM needs to comply with, such as:

* ATM must provide a REST API for ATMPartners to subscribe to ATMTopics of interest.
* ATM must deliver messages about ATMTopics of interest to ATMPartners in a message queue middleware.
* ATM is restricted to using message queues and is not allowed to use topics (from an implementation perspective in the middleware).
* ATM must create a queue per subscription.
* ATM must ensure that the created queues are exclusively consumed by the ATMPartner who requested the subscription.
* ATM must build an environment that supports part of the solution developed in Spring Boot 3, which will be provided by an external institution.

Additionally, ATM presents other challenges such as:

* Establish the credentialing process flow for ATMPartner.
* Define the solution architecture.
* Determine which technologies to use to develop the solution.
* How to deploy the project in a scalable and secure environment.
* How to control the lifecycle of generated artifacts.
* How to train the internal team to be able to maintain the solution.
* Define application models and create reference architectures as well as prototypes for future implementations.


## Sample flows

### Registration Flow Sequence Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor A as Institution
    actor B as Credential Management Entity

    A->>B: Registration Request (essential data)
    activate B
    B->>Keycloak: Register Institution (essential data)
    activate Keycloak
    Keycloak-->>B: Registration Confirmation (user created, credentials, role)
    deactivate Keycloak

    B-->>A: Registration Notification (credentials and role)
    deactivate B

    Note over B: Role created for A is important for future use
```
